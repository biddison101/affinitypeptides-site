**Affinity Peptides** is an independent, research-focused platform dedicated to the scientific exploration of peptide biology, metabolic health, and regenerative medicine.

The purpose of this site is to curate, organize, and interpret peer-reviewed biomedical research in a way that is accessible, transparent, and evidence-based.

We focus on:
- Peptide signaling and receptor biology  
- Metabolic regulation and obesity research  
- Growth hormone and tissue regeneration  
- Inflammatory and immune modulation  
- Emerging therapeutic peptides  

All information published on this platform is derived from:
- PubMed indexed studies  
- University research  
- Clinical trial data  
- Major medical journals  

This site does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It exists purely as an educational and scientific knowledge base for researchers, clinicians, and scientifically curious individuals.
