## Independent Research on Peptides, Metabolic Health, and Regenerative Biology

**Affinity Peptides** is an independent, research-focused knowledge platform dedicated to the scientific exploration of peptide therapeutics, metabolic optimization, and regenerative medicine.

We curate, analyze, and summarize peer-reviewed research from leading biomedical journals, universities, and clinical trials to help researchers, clinicians, and educated individuals better understand emerging peptide-based technologies.

This platform is designed for:
- Researchers and students studying peptide biology  
- Clinicians and healthcare professionals  
- Biohackers and scientifically minded individuals  
- Anyone seeking evidence-based information on metabolic and regenerative peptides  

We do **not** provide medical advice or sell products on this website. Our mission is to make high-quality scientific information accessible and transparent.
