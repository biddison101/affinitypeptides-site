# MOTS-c Peptide  
### The Mitochondrial Master Switch for Fat Loss, Energy, and Longevity

## What Is MOTS-c?

MOTS-c (Mitochondrial Open-Reading-Frame of the 12S rRNA – Type C) is a naturally occurring mitochondrial-encoded peptide. Unlike hormones made in the cell nucleus, MOTS-c is produced inside the mitochondria, the energy factories of the cell.

It functions as a systemic metabolic regulator that controls how the body:
- Uses glucose  
- Burns fat  
- Produces cellular energy  
- Preserves lean muscle  
- Responds to stress  
- Ages at the cellular level  

MOTS-c is released naturally during exercise, fasting, and metabolic stress. It signals the body to shift into fat-burning, high-energy, and repair mode.

As we age, MOTS-c levels decline. Low MOTS-c is associated with:
- Obesity  
- Insulin resistance  
- Type 2 diabetes  
- Fatty liver  
- Low energy  
- Poor endurance  
- Accelerated aging

## How MOTS-c Works

MOTS-c activates the body’s master metabolic regulator:

### AMPK (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase)

This is the same pathway activated by:
- Exercise  
- Fasting  
- Metformin  
- Calorie restriction  

When AMPK is activated, the body enters:
- Fat burning  
- Increased glucose uptake into muscle  
- Mitochondrial activation  
- Anti-inflammatory signaling  
- Longevity gene expression  

MOTS-c also:
- Increases GLUT-4 glucose transport  
- Boosts fatty acid oxidation  
- Improves mitochondrial efficiency  
- Activates NRF2 antioxidant genes  
- Suppresses myostatin  
- Supports bone formation  
- Reduces inflammatory cytokines  
- Moves into the nucleus to activate stress-response and repair genes  

This is why MOTS-c is often called “exercise in a vial.”

## What MOTS-c Does

### Metabolism
- Improves insulin sensitivity  
- Lowers fasting glucose  
- Reduces fatty liver  
- Increases metabolic rate  
- Reverses metabolic syndrome  

### Fat Loss
- Increases fat oxidation  
- Preserves lean muscle  
- Enhances fasting and cardio fat burn  

### Performance
- Improves endurance  
- Increases mitochondrial energy output  
- Reduces muscle fatigue  

### Longevity
- Declines with age  
- Restores youthful mitochondrial function  
- Activates AMPK, NRF2, and longevity pathways  
- In animal studies, increases lifespan and healthspan  

### Bone & Inflammation
- Increases bone formation  
- Reduces bone breakdown  
- Suppresses inflammatory signaling

## Human Evidence

- Exercise increases MOTS-c in muscle up to 12×  
- Blood levels rise after workouts  
- Obese and diabetic individuals have lower MOTS-c  
- Aging reduces MOTS-c by ~20%  
- A MOTS-c drug (CB4211) lowered liver enzymes and glucose in obese humans

## Why People Use MOTS-c

- Fat loss without muscle loss  
- Insulin resistance and pre-diabetes  
- Fatty liver  
- Energy and endurance  
- Metabolic reset  
- Longevity  
- Mitochondrial repair  
- Recovery from metabolic damage

## How MOTS-c Is Used

- Route: Subcutaneous injection  
- Not oral  
- Best timing: Morning, fasted  
- Often before cardio or training
