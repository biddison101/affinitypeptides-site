title: "Retatrutide"
---

## Overview

Retatrutide is an investigational triple-agonist peptide designed to target three key metabolic hormone receptors involved in weight regulation and glucose control:

- GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1)  
- GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide)  
- Glucagon receptor  

This multi-receptor approach is intended to improve metabolic flexibility, enhance fat loss, and preserve lean mass more effectively than single-pathway therapies.

## Mechanism of Action

## Mechanism of Action

Retatrutide activates:

| Receptor | Function |
|--------|---------|
| GLP-1 | Reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, increases insulin secretion |
| GIP | Enhances insulin response and nutrient partitioning |
| Glucagon | Increases energy expenditure and fat oxidation |

By stimulating all three pathways, Retatrutide produces a synergistic metabolic effect that promotes weight loss while supporting glycemic control.

## Clinical Evidence

Phase 2 human clinical trials demonstrated:

- Significant reductions in body fat  
- Improved insulin sensitivity  
- Preservation of lean tissue compared to GLP-1–only drugs  

In several studies, subjects achieved double-digit percentage reductions in total body weight over short study periods.

## Research Context

Triple-agonist peptides represent the next generation of metabolic therapeutics. Retatrutide builds upon earlier GLP-1 drugs (such as semaglutide and tirzepatide) by adding a glucagon receptor component, increasing fat oxidation and metabolic rate.

---

## Safety Considerations

Retatrutide remains an investigational compound. Reported side effects in clinical trials include:

- Nausea  
- Gastrointestinal discomfort  
- Appetite suppression  

Long-term safety continues to be evaluated in ongoing clinical research.
